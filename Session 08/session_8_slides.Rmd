]
.pull-right[
- Topic models offer an automated procedure to discover the main "themes" in an unstructured corpus of texts

- Can be used to understand and organize large collections of documents according to the discovered themes (e.g. New York Times articles from 2019-2020)
]
<br>
- Unsupervised learning: topic models require no labeled data - only a set of documents

- Mixture model: Documents can contain multiple topics; words can belong to multiple topics (as opposed to k-means for example)

# Univariate probability density function

<img src="../figures/univariate_probability_density.jpg" class="centerimg">

Different parameter values (e.g. $\mu$ and $\sigma$ for the normal distribution) change the distributions’ shape 

The notation $x \sim N(0, 1)$ denotes to sample or draw $x$ from a standard normal distribution. This draw could e.g. return x = −1.124.


---
# Multivariate probability density function 

<img src="../figures/multivariate_probability_density.jpg" class="centerimg">

A draw $a \sim N(\mu, \Sigma)$ from this multivariate normal distribution
could e.g. return a = (−0.12, 1.2)

# Standard simplex


<img src="../figures/standard_simplex.jpg" class="centerimg" width="35%">

#### Graphical intuition of a standard simplex

A point on the triangle is $x_1 , x_2 , x_3$, with $x_1 , x_2 , x_3 \in [0, 1]$ and
$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1$. For example, (0.05, 0.8, 0.15)

Generalizes to higher dimensions with $x_1 , ..., x_k \in [0, 1]$ and $\sum x_k = 1$

.pull-right[

X is a discrete random variable with three categories x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, and x<sub>3</sub>

The figure shows a multinomial distribution with probabilities [0.2, 0.7, 0.1]. 

A draw X ~ Multinomial([0.2, 0.7, 0.1]) is most likely to return the second category
]

# Key distribution 2: Dirichlet distribution

####The Dirichlet distribution is a probability distribution over a simplex

<img src="../figures/dirichlet_distribution.jpg" class="centerimg">

####We can draw a multinomial distribution from a Dirichlet distribution


- A draw b ~ Dir(&alpha;) from this distribution could e.g. return b = (0.2, 0.7, 0.1)
- Hence, we can think of the draw from a Dirichlet distribution being
itself a multinomial distribution (previous slide)

# Topic models

# Topic models: main idea 

#### Intuition

Topic models reverse-engineer the writing process of documents with a sequence of probabilistic steps

--

#### Generative probabilistic model

Topic models models assume a *fixed number of topics* which are *distributions over words*, and each document has a *distribution over topics*

--

Each document is "written" by randomly sampling a topic from a document-topic distribution, then sampling a word from that topic distribution. Repeat that process until you have all words in the text.

--

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) by [Blei et al. (2003)](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/BleiNgJordan2003.pdf) is a common approach but there are extensions such as Structural Topic models (STM) by [Roberts et al (2014)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24363543)

Assume that some number of topics exists for the corpus. A topic is 

Each document is assumed to be generated as follows

1. Choose a topic from the distribution over K topics (histogram on the right)
2. For each word, choose a topic assignment (the colored circles) and choose the word from the assigned topic

# LDA: General case

<!-- Idea: Assume a statistical model that generated the observed corpus, then estimate the model and recover latent (unobserved) quantities, i.e. under the assumptions made -->

#### Let's look more closely at how LDA assumes our document have been generated 


- We consider a corpus of $D$ document, each with $N_d$ words

- For each document $d \in {1, ..., D}$, draw its *topic shares* from a Dirichlet distribution $\theta_d \sim \text{Dir}(\alpha)$

--

- For each topic $k \in {1, ..., K}$, draw its *word shares* from a second Dirichlet distribution $\beta_k \sim \text{Dir}(\eta)$

--

- Fill each document with words. For each document-word position $d,n$ in $d \in {1, ..., D}$ and $n \in {1, ..., N_d}$

  - Choose the topic $z_{d,n}$ of the document-word position by taking a draw from document $d$'s topic distribution: $z_{d,n} \sim \text{Multinomial}(\theta_d)$
  
--
  
  - Choose the word $w_{d,n}$ by taking a draw from the corresponding topic distribution: $w_{d,n} \sim \text{Multinomial}(\beta_{z_{d,n}})$


---
# LDA: stylized example

Let us first imagine a stylized corpus with only $D=5$ documents, $N=8$ words per document (and also 8 unique words in the corpus in total), and $K=3$ topics

--

- For each of the 5 documents, draw its topic shares from a Dirichlet distribution $\theta_d \sim \text{Dir}(\alpha)$. For document 1 this could e.g. yield $\theta_1=(0.1,0.8,0.1)$, i.e. document 1 consists predominantly of topic 2

--

- For each of the 3 topics, draw its word shares from a second Dirichlet distribution $\beta_k \sim \text{Dir}(\eta)$. For topic 2 this e.g. yield $\beta_2=(0,0,0,0.1, 0,0, 0.4, 0.5)$, i.e. topic consists predominantly of words 7 and 8. 

--


- Now it is possible to fill each document with words. For each document-word position $d,n$

  - Choose the topic $z_{d,n}$ of the document-word position by talking a draw from document $d$'s topic distribution: $z_{d,n} \sim \text{Multinomial}(\theta_d)$
  
  - Choose the word $w_{d,n}$ by taking a draw from the corresponding topic distribution: $w_{d,n}$



---
# Estimation output

Say we have a corpus with $D=1,000$ documents, a vocabulary of $V=10,000$ total unique words/n-grams, and choose $K=3$ topics. The final output after estimating the topic model could be 

#### Topic shares for each document

#### Word shares for each topic

<img src="../figures/topic_models_beta_matrix_example.jpg">

---
# Topics

- What is referred to as a "topic" is a row vector in $\beta$ with a probability for every word in the corpus to belong to that topic

- For example, the second topic is the second row vector &beta;<sub>2</sub> = [&beta;<sub>2,1</sub>   &beta;<sub>2,2</sub>   ... &beta;<sub>2,10000</sub>] = [0.00002  0.001 ...  0.05]

- Put differently, a topic is a collection of word probabilities, names which summarizes their meaning are given by humans

.pull-right[
- A topic us often visualized via a word cloud where the size of words corresponds to their frequency in the vector

- The figures shows a topic which could be termed "astronomy".

# Estimation intuition

- Estimation the topic models is done in a Bayesian framework

- Our $\text{Dir}(\alpha)$ and $\text{Dir}(\eta)$ are the so called *prior distributions* of the $\theta_d$ and $\beta_k$

- With Bayes' theorem, with the help of our data, and the model, we update these prior distributions to obtain a so called *posterior distribution* for each $\theta_d$ and $\beta_k$

- The means of these posterior distributions are the rows in the above matrices commonly given by statistical packages and referred to as $\theta$ and $\beta$


---
# Obtain posterior distributions

- Algorithms to obtain posterior distributions are not the focus of this lecture 

- Common algorithm to obtain posterior distributions for the $\theta_d$ and $\beta_k$ are from two main groups

  1. Sampling algorithms such as **Gibbs sampling** approximate the posterior distribution with an empirical distribution by drawing a sequence of samples in a way that ensure its limit distribution is the true posterior distribution
  
  2. **Variational methods** approximate the posterior distribution with a  parametrized family of distributions. The error of this approximation  is minimized and obtaining posterors thus becomes an optimization problem

# Extensions
------------

---
# Correlated topic model 

- Blei and Lafferty (2005, 2007) developed the correlated topic model (CTM)

- It swaps the Dirichlet distribution of topic shares in documents (&theta;) with a logistic normal normal distribution

- The logistic normal distribution is also defined over a simplex, however, unlike the Dirichlet distribution, it also allows to model correlations (between topics) through a covariance matrix

- This can return estimates of correlations between the topics
and can also lead to a better fit


---
# Structural topic model

The structural topic model was introduced by Roberts et al. (2013)

#### Topic prevalence covariates

Topic proportions within documents can vary through covariates 

E.g. social media posts by Republican politicians might have different topic proportions than those posted by Democrats

--

<br>

#### Topical content covariates

Word proportions within topics can vary through covariates 

E.g. when talking about a health care topic, Republican politicians might use different words than Democrats

<br>

Without any covariates supplied, the model reduce to the correlated topic model

# Selecting K and beyond 

#### Challenge

In particular selecting the amount of topics K, but also parameters, covariates, and potentially initializations is a very challenging exercise without a single solution

#### What to do?

####Researchers typically consult a combination of quantitative metrics and human judgment

---
# Quantitative metrics

#### Held-out likelihood or perplexity 

For some held-out documents, how likely would the model have generated/predicted these documents

--

#### Semantic coherence

For example, how likely do the most common words from a topic also co-occur in the same document?

--

#### Exclusivity

Do words with high probability in one topic have low probabilities in others?

--

<br>

Many automated metrics exist, see e.g. Grimmer and Stewart (2013), Mimno et al. (2011), Taddy (2012)

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # On held-out likelihood metrics -->

<!-- - Held-out likelihood and perplexity allow to judge the -->
<!-- predictive ability of the model -->

<!-- - Yet, choosing K such that it achieves the highest held-out -->
<!-- likelihood has serious limitations -->

<!-- - Rather than creating an auto-complete prediction model or -->
<!-- something similar, the purpose of topic modeling most often -->
<!-- is to obtain coherent topics that tell a story -->

<!-- - In their paper “Reading tea leaves” (2009) Chang et al. contrast likelihood based metrics with human judgments about topic coherence -->

<!-- - Also see this short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfHCronRgQU) by one of the authors -->

<!-- # Reading tea leaves -->

<!-- <img> -->

<!-- From: “Reading Tea Leaves: How Humans Interpret Topic Models” by Chang -->
<!-- et al., 2009 -->

<!-- Likelihood based metrics were actually negatively correlated with human -->
<!-- metrics about topic coherence -->

---
# Quantitative metrics


#### According to Roberts et al. (2014), a semantically interpretable topic has two qualities: 

1. It is **cohesive** in the sense that high-probability words for the topic tend to co-occur within documents

2. It is **exclusive** in the sense that the top words for that topic are unlikely to appear with in top words of other topics.

--

Semantic coherence and exclusivity, with many other quantitative metrics, are outputs of the function ‘searchK‘ in the ‘stm’ package

--


For a discussion of model selection for (structural) topic models (e.g. different choices of K, initializations, and covariates) and evaluation, see e.g. Section “3.4. Evaluate: Model selection and search” in the package vignette or the Section Model Specification and Selection in “Structural Topic Models for Open-Ended Survey Responses” by Roberts et al. (2014)




---
# Takeaways

####No quantitative metric can replace human judgement when selecting K or other model parameters, and evaluating the fit of a particular topic model more generally

- “The most effective method for assessing model fit is to carefully read documents that are closely associated with particular topics to verify that the semantic concept covered by the topic is reflected in the text.” from “A Model of Text for Experimentation in the Social Sciences” by Roberts et al. (2016)

- The ‘plotQuote‘ function in `stm` allows to plot documents highly
associated with certain topics

- Key consideration: What is the goal of the current model?

- To generate coherent topics which describe themes? Combine careful human reading with quantitative metrics

- To use topic models e.g. for document embeddings to find similar documents? As input in a predictive model? Try to select K and other parameters such that they maximize whatever the objective function


---
# Example

A carefully documented project with very good average topic coherence is e.g. “Leaders or Followers? Measuring Political Responsiveness in the U.S. Congress Using Social Media Data” by Barberá et al. (2014)

- Data: 651,116 tweets sent by US legislators from January 2013 to
December 2014

- 2,920 documents = 730 days × 2 chambers × 2 parties

- Why aggregating? Applications that aggregate by author or day
outperform tweet-level analyses (Hong and Davidson, 2010)
- Sidenote: For short texts, such as also e.g. survey responses, topic models such as sparse additive generative models (SAGE) might create more coherent topics than e.g. LDA (see e.g. Bauer et al, Political Behavior, 2017)

- K = 100 topics

- Validation: http://j.mp/lda-congress-demo 

---
# Implementations in R

For an implementation of the LDA and CTM, see e.g. the
package `topicmodels`

- We will focus on the `stm` package which offers a range of helpful functionalities

- Without added covariates, the `stm` function also estimates a standard CTM, with covariates a structural topic model

- Further helpful package to visualize topic models are `LDAvis` or, the stm-specific, `stminsights`

# Before we move on

- If you are interested in using the Twitter API in the next weeks, please apply for a developer account

- Applications can be done via https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps and take some time to be processed 

- After your application is approved, you can create an app within a project or a standalone app

- This will create a 1) key and a 2) key secret

- Afterwards you can create 3) an access token and 4) an access token secret 

These four strings/characters will be used to access the API, e.g. via the package `rtweet`
